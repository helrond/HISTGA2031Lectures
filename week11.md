##Semantic

##Structural

##Syntactic



##Semantic
Mapping elements or fields with equivalent meaning(s)

Crosswalks for data structure standards AND data value standards

Cross-domain searching and data conversion



##Structural
A structured data model associated with a semantic schema

Define and share metadata



##Syntactic
Shared markup languages and data format standards

Communicate, transport, store and represent metadata



##Data conversion is hard!



##Why?



Semantics are fuzzy

Intertwined description of original and surrogate

Mapping one element to many, or many to one

Missing elements and data loss

Changing application of descriptive rules

Differences in granularity

Hierarchical vs. flat structures



##Networked Discovery

Union catalogs

Metadata harvesting

Internet



##What do users expect?



Comprehensiveness

Currency

Relevance

Speed



##What are some of the barriers to these expectations?



Bad data - missing, incomplete, confusing or incorrect

Mapping problems

People - perceptions, motivations, intelligence

Capitalism



##Metadata as interface and platform



##Data is not neutral



#Think big!
