# Archival Representation


## Archival representation has evolved and continues to evolve


## Understand and appreciate legacy representations...so you can iterate on them and create useful foundations for the next generation


# Users and user needs


## We know very little about our users or their needs...still


## Information seeking behavior and user studies are a relatively young and evolving field


## Assumptions and conclusions in this area tend to become outdated very quickly, so need to find ways to learn about our users constantly and iteratively
