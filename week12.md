Usability

What it is, why it matters, how to do it



#What makes something usable?



>A person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can figure out how to use the thing to accomplish something without it being more trouble than it&rsquo;s worth.

<small>-Steve Krug</small>



#Don&rsquo;t make me think <small>(unnecessarily)</small>



##Obvious &larr;&rarr; Requires Thought



##Shoot for self-evident, settle for self-explanatory



#Why does usability matter?



##It's how we measure whether or not we're meeting our goal of serving users



##Emotions matter



##Human-centered



##Improving UX is a way of improving ourselves



##Interfaces are political, therefore UX is political



##UX is about experience, not technology



##Scanning

##Satisficing
Choosing the first reasonable option, rather than looking for the best one



##We do this because...
1. time matters
2. there&rsquo;s no penalty for guessing wrong
3. weighing choice doesn&rsquo;t always improve result
4. guessing/serendipity is fun



##Muddling through
Using a system without fully understanding how it works
