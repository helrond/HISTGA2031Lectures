Metadata



#What is metadata?



# &ldquo;Metadata is cataloging done by men.&rdquo;



# &ldquo;data about data&rdquo;

##Constructed

##Constructive

##Actionable



#Constructed

Metadata is not found in nature; it is a human construction.



#Constructive

Metadata is constructed for some purpose or activity; usually to solve a problem.  



#Actionable

In order for metadata to serve its purpose, it must support or initiate action by humans and machines.



##Kinds of metadata

Administrative

Descriptive

Preservation

Technical

Use



#Structured Data
Tables of contents, footnotes, indexes, fields, tags



##Why does structure matter?
Help humans navigate information

Structure creates actionability, particularly for machines

More is not necessarily better



#Metadata bingo!



#Why Standards Matter



# They make things easier for our users



## Structure text into data

Machines read our description first



## Allow our data to be reused

Increases the number of way our collections can be accessed

Widens the audiences who can find and use our collections

Keeps our collections (and us) relevant to future researchers

Makes innovative uses of our material (or uses we would never have thought of) possible



## Improve current and future search capabilities

More consistent search through controlled vocabularies

More focused search possibilities through structured data

More intuitive search by making similar types of information available in consistent ways



## Make archival resources easier to understand and use



# They make things easier for us



##Facilitating more efficient and consistent description processes
Decreasing the number of editing cycles for our finding aids and accession records

Making our finding aids more consistent

Increasing the lifespan of our description

Allowing our description to be maintained and migrated over time

Allowing for more efficient training and procedures, not reinventing the wheel



## Making it easier to manage change
Staff turnover

Technology and systems

New/revised standards



## Improving cooperation between institutions
Working with other institutions is difficult unless our description adheres to standards

Consortia often rely on sharing description and presenting it in each institutionâ€™s discovery systems

Services such as federated search rely on structured data to work



# Kinds of Standards
Structure Standards

Content Standards

Data Value Standards



## Structure Standards
Define the elements of information, their order and relationship to one another

<strong>Benefits</strong>: the need for development of unique software is reduced and exchange of data is facilitated

<strong>Examples</strong>: EAD, MARC, DC, MODS



## Content Standards
Rules for entering information in each element defined in structure standards, for example punctuation and capitalization, expressing dates and quantities, and required vs. optional elements

<strong>Benefits</strong>: increased data integrity

<strong>Examples</strong>: DACS, AACR2



## Data Value Standards (controlled vocabularies)
Lists or tables of terms, names, alphanumeric codes, or other specific entities that are acceptable for entry in a particular data element, including code lists and thesauri

<strong>Benefits</strong>: increased data integrity

<strong>Examples</strong>: LCSH, LCNAF, Getty vocabularies (AAT, ULAN, TGM)



##	Data Format/Technical Interchange/Encoding Standards
Machine readable serialization of a data structure standard

<strong>Benefits</strong>: streamlined data exchange between systems

<strong>Examples</strong>: MARCXML, MARC21, EAD XML
